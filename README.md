bitcoin replace-by-fee double spend tool

gangsta, bitcoin double spend tool aimed to work with replace-by-fee patched nodes

demo: http://gangsta.dassori.me/ (hosted code is NOT SAFE, DO NOT PASTE important private keys into a non-safe environment, you could expect losses)

Todo:
- about & FAQ
- switch api calls from blockr to insight-api, since it can be self-hosted
- push server ui selection
- get rid of transactions polling and use insight websocket api
- 'funds from other keys' feature
- quick switch between testnet & mainnet
- bugfix
- tx builder from scratch, to handle both spends from gangsta, instead of using a third-party client
- generally, more development

Bug reports, feedback, forks, pull reqs, blames, everything is appreciated.
